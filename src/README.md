## 🏗️ Architecture Features

### ✅ Professional Organization
- **Clean separation of concerns** - Each folder has a specific purpose
- **Scalable structure** - Easy to add new features and components
- **Import organization** - Barrel exports for cleaner imports

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- **TypeScript throughout** - Proper type definitions for all components
- **Error handling** - Centralized error handling utilities
- **Storage management** - Abstracted storage operations
- **Authentication flow** - Clean auth hook with proper state management

### ✅ Developer Experience
- **Consistent naming** - All files follow consistent naming conventions
- **Modular design** - Easy to find and modify specific functionality
- **Reusable components** - Hooks and services can be easily reused

## 🚀 Key Components

### `useAuth` Hook
Manages authentication state throughout the app:
- Token management
- Loading states
- Login/logout functionality

### Authentication Service
Handles all API authentication calls:
- Login and registration
- Token storage
- Error handling

### Storage Service
Abstracted storage operations:
- Secure token storage
- Error handling
- Clean API

### Navigation
Centralized navigation configuration:
- Type-safe navigation
- Authentication-based routing
- Clean screen organization

## 📋 Development Guidelines

1. **Adding new screens**: Place in `src/screens/` and export from `index.ts`
2. **Creating utilities**: Add to `src/utils/` with proper typing
3. **API services**: Place in `src/services/` following the auth service pattern
4. **Custom hooks**: Add to `src/hooks/` with proper return types
5. **Type definitions**: Add to `src/types/` with clear naming

## 🔧 Migration Summary

The codebase has been reorganized from a flat structure to a professional, scalable architecture:

- ✅ Moved all pages to `src/screens/`
- ✅ Extracted authentication logic to `useAuth` hook
- ✅ Created centralized API services
- ✅ Added utility functions and constants
- ✅ Improved TypeScript types
- ✅ Centralized navigation logic
- ✅ Added error handling and logging

All existing functionality has been preserved while improving code organization and maintainability.
